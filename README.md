# About me

- ðŸ¥¸ I studied electronic engineering because I wanted to improve people's lives through powerful devices that make their daily tasks easier. However, as I started my professional career in the industry, I discovered a deep passion for software developmentâ€”especially when combined with embedded systems programming. The intersection of hardware and software fascinated me, and I quickly realized how impactful well-designed software can be in bringing embedded systems to life.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at [Sirden](https://es.linkedin.com/company/sirden), where I work with embedded systems, and also develop software for third parties.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m fully committed to learning rust. I find it a very powerful and enriching language, that is helping me grow as a developer, and an engineer, changing the way I think. Also, I think it will be a key language in the future to come.
